    h3 What is a black hole?
    p A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape is called the event horizon. Inside the event horizon, the gravitational pull is so intense that it warps spacetime and creates a singularity, a point of infinite density where the laws of physics as we know them break down.
    p Black holes can vary in size, from small stellar-mass black holes formed from the collapse of individual stars, to supermassive black holes that reside at the centers of galaxies and contain millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun. Despite their name, black holes can emit radiation through a process called Hawking radiation, which allows them to slowly lose mass over time.
    p Black holes play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe, as they influence the formation and evolution of galaxies, and provide insights into the nature of gravity and spacetime.

        p This is an article about black holes. Black holes are fascinating cosmic objects that have captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, creating a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape is called the event horizon. Inside the event horizon, the gravitational pull is so intense that it warps spacetime and creates a singularity, a point of infinite density where the laws of physics as we know them break down.

            h2 More About Black Holes
        section
            p Black holes are often detected by observing their effects on nearby matter. When a black hole pulls in gas and dust from its surroundings, the material heats up and emits X-rays that can be detected by telescopes. Additionally, the gravitational influence of a black hole can cause stars to orbit around it at high speeds, providing further evidence of its presence.
